# Wine Quality Classification using SQC and PCA in R

This project applies **Statistical Quality Control (SQC)** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to classify wine quality using R. It also integrates various machine learning models to evaluate and compare classification performance.

## ðŸ“Š Objective

To implement data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (via PCA), and SQC analysis for enhancing wine quality classification and visualization in R.

## ðŸ§ª Methods Used

- **Statistical Quality Control (SQC)**: Used for quality assessment and identifying process variation.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Applied for dimensionality reduction.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest (best-performing)
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Trees

## ðŸ”§ Procedure

The complete R script for performing Statistical Quality Control (SQC) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is included in the repository:

- ðŸ“„ `SQC_PCA_Procedure.R`

### ðŸªœ Steps Followed in the Script:

1. **Load the Dataset**  
   - Read white and red wine datasets using `read.csv()`.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Combine datasets (if needed).
   - Handle missing values and standardize features.

3. **Apply PCA**  
   - Use `prcomp()` to perform PCA.
   - Visualize variance explained and principal components.

4. **Perform SQC Analysis**  
   - Calculate control limits.
   - Generate control charts (X-bar, R, S charts) using custom functions or `qcc` package.

5. **Apply Machine Learning Models**  
   - Use `randomForest`, `knn`, etc. for classification.
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

6. **Visualize Results**  
   - Use `ggplot2` and `factoextra` for plots.

7. **Conclusion & Interpretation**  
   - Highlight best-performing model and how PCA/SQC improved results.

# Wine Quality Classification using SQC and PCA in R

This project applies **Statistical Quality Control (SQC)** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to classify wine quality using R. It also integrates various machine learning models to evaluate and compare classification performance.

## ðŸ“Š Objective

To implement data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (via PCA), and SQC analysis for enhancing wine quality classification and visualization in R.

## ðŸ§ª Methods Used

- **Statistical Quality Control (SQC)**: Used for quality assessment and identifying process variation.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Applied for dimensionality reduction.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest (best-performing)
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Trees

## ðŸ“‚ Procedure

The step-by-step R script used for data preprocessing, SQC implementation, PCA transformation, and model evaluation is available in the `code/` folder:
- `procedure.R`
